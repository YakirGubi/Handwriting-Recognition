The only thing you need to do for this code work, is to run the main, 
(if it is your first run, TensorFlow would download the MNIST dataSet), 
then the computer train it self on the dataSet, 
after it finish you get a window to draw on it, 
afer you finish close the window and "Plots" will open and new window for new digit,
the AI "gess" will be print in the terminal.
if you want to close the project you need to stop it from the IDE ;)
