The only thing you need to do for this code work, is to run the main, 
(if it is your first run TensorFlow would download the MNIS dataSet), 
then the coumputer train it self on the dataSet, 
after it finish you get a window to write on it, 
afer you finish close the window and "Plots" will open and new window for new digit.
if you want to close the project you need to stop it from the IDE ;)
